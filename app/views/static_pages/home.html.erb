      <p class="grindbody">The concept for the brand brewed my Senior year of undergrad, 08-09. Abilene was a small city so there wasn't much to do, talented folks became sleepy; it happens everywhere and I wanted to change that. I worked at the local McDonald's at the time and during a morning rush, some customers ordered coffee but it had to be the freshest possible.</p>

<p class="grindbody_sub">my head. Why not flip this concept that caffeine wakes you up, to waking up the creative within and to pursue that dream you had?
